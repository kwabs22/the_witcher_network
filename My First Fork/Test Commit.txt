Test for forking Files. 
Main Reason for fork is to learn file structure traversal notetaking on a smaller project so I can learn from useful repos like this one while having notes as close to the source as possible as these file structures used are crazy without context.

Main Objective is learning therefore cant disturb the structure of the fork but can make own directory inside the fork to Experiment (Can even mirror the file structure)
By only changing read me and Adding search bookmarks this can be achieved while in a new folder efforts can be compared to original without leaving the directory


For me UI backwards approach is the easiest way to understand as everything else is inevitably abstract intangible concepts
Direct UI Components = src, examples, demos, ui, pakages, etc.
Links to ui = Assets, CSS files, etc.

Changelog = Logic Flow of the Creator ==> Easier History to understand History play by play rather going back to random points as the full scope of possibilities is lost
