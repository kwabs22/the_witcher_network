Test for forking Files. 
Main Reason for fork is to learn file structure traversal notetaking on a smaller project so I can learn from useful repos like this one while having notes as close to the source as possible as these file structures used are crazy without context.

For me UI backwards approach is the easiest way to understand as everything else is inevitably abstract intangible concepts
Direct UI Components = src, examples, demos, ui, pakages, etc.
Links to ui = Assets, CSS files, etc.
